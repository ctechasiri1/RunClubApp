RunClubApp
==========

**RunClubApp** is a mobile application designed to organize, track, and motivate running groups and individual runners. It aims to foster a **community spirit** while providing essential, data-driven tools for training and progress monitoring.

This project demonstrates proficiency in building a **location-aware**, data-intensive application for a dedicated fitness niche, highlighting competence in **SwiftUI**, **Core Location**, and **Supabase** for data persistence.

‚ú® Features
----------

The application is structured around three core pillars: tracking, community, and progress.

### üèÉ Activity Tracking

*   **GPS Tracking:** Records route visualization, distance, pace, elevation, and duration for every run with high precision.
    
*   **Real-Time Metrics:** Displays live speed, distance, and time during the activity for immediate feedback.
    
*   **Historical Data:** Provides a detailed, accessible log of all past runs with comprehensive summary statistics.
    
*   **HealthKit Integration (iOS):** Synchronizes run data seamlessly with the user's Apple Health records for holistic fitness tracking.    

### üìä Progress & Goals

*   **Personal Bests (PBs):** Automatically tracks, highlights, and celebrates new personal records (e.g., fastest 5K, 10K, longest distance).
    
*   **Goal Setting:** Set and monitor personalized distance goals for the week or month, providing visual feedback on progress.
    

üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used
---------------------

This project leverages modern iOS development standards and a robust open-source backend:

*   **Language:** **Swift**
    
*   **UI Framework:** **SwiftUI** (utilizing the latest declarative patterns)
    
*   **Mapping:** **MapKit** (for displaying and tracking routes with custom overlays)
    
*   **Health Data:** **HealthKit** (for deep integration with the iOS health ecosystem)
    
*   **Location Services:** **Core Location** (for accurate, battery-efficient GPS data)
    
*   **Backend/Data Storage:** **Supabase** (used for user **Authentication**, real-time data with **Postgres**, and storage).
